## Brainwave
A workshop exploring autonomous compute.

#### How we think
We're a small workshop building at the boundary of hardware and software.

Our work spans:
- Infrastructure for realtime perception
- Efficient inference for multimodal models
- New foundations for heterogeneous compute

Clarity and a commitment to craft are non-negotiable.

We invest in each other.

We're not in a hurry.
