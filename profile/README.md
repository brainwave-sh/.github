## Brainwave Computing

Brainwave Computing is a small consulting and engineering practice focused on perception software — sensors, pipelines, models, and the tooling needed to make them reliable in production.

### What we work on
- Camera and sensor pipelines  
- Real-time and heterogeneous compute  
- Edge inference for perception models  
- Telemetry for robotic deployments  
- Cross-platform UI, including 3D graphics  

### How we think
The purpose of software is to help humans understand what a machine is doing. Clarity and a commitment to craft are therefore non-negotiable.
