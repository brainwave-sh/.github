## Brainwave Computing
Brainwave Computing is a small consulting and engineering practice focused on infrastructure for real-time perception systems — sensors, pipelines, models, and the tooling needed to make them reliable in production.

### What We Work On
- Camera and sensor pipelines
- Edge inference for perception models
- Real-time and heterogeneous compute
- Telemetry for robotic deployments
- Cross-platform UI, including 3D graphics

### How We Think
The purpose of software is to help humans understand what a machine is doing. Clarity and a commitment to craft are therefore non-negotiable.
