## Brainwave
A workshop exploring autonomous compute.

### How we think
We're a small workshop building at the boundary of hardware and software.

Our work spans new foundations for heterogeneous compute, infrastructure for real-time perception systems, and efficient inference for multi-modal models.

Clarity and a commitment to craft are non-negotiable.

We work close to the metal, and we're drawn to problems that reward patience and an absurd attention to detail. We use the right tool for the job. If it doesn't exist, we build it.

We invest in each other.

We're not in a hurry.
